# üìö On-Chain Story Game - Development Roadmap

> A decentralized storytelling platform where communities collaboratively write stories through blockchain-based voting, with each chapter minted as an NFT and revenue shared among contributors.

## üöÄ Project Status

- [x] **Project Scaffolding** - Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript frontend
- [x] **Smart Contract Foundation** - Foundry/Forge setup with basic Counter contract
- [x] **Smart Contract Development** - Core contracts implementation
- [ ] **Frontend Development** - User interface and flows
- [ ] **Backend Services** - API and blockchain integration
- [ ] **Testing & Deployment** - Comprehensive testing and mainnet deployment

---

## üÜï Recent Changes

- Updated `contracts/src/PlotVoting.sol` to enable free voting and optional staking:
  - Voting is now free (`vote()` no longer requires ETH).
  - Added `stakeForProposal()` so voters can optionally stake ETH to earn pro‚Äërata rewards if their chosen proposal wins.
  - Execution distributes author stake + voter stakes (60% author / 30% stakers / 10% platform in-contract).
  - Rejection refunds author stake and all voter optional stakes.

- Frontend updates for Voting UI:
  - Added Recent Proposals list with status, votes, staked, voters, and deadlines in `frontend/src/app/voting/page.tsx`.
  - Implemented chain-aware explorer links and toast notifications for actions.
  - Added optional Story ID filter (uses `getStoryProposals(storyId)` via `useProposals`).
  - Formatted stake values in ETH (viem `formatEther`).
  - Auto-refresh proposals via on-chain event listeners (`ProposalSubmitted`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalExecuted`, `ProposalRejected`).
  - Mounted global `<Toaster />` in `Providers` for app-wide toasts.

#### Core Contracts
- [x] **StoryNFT.sol** - ERC721 implementation for story chapters
  - [x] Chapter struct and mapping
  - [x] Minting functionality
  - [x] Metadata retrieval
  - [x] Access control and permissions

- [x] **PlotVoting.sol** - Chapter proposal and voting system
  - [x] Proposal submission with author stake
  - [x] Free token-weighted voting (no ETH required)
  - [x] Optional voter staking for rewards (stakeForProposal)
  - [x] Voting deadline management
  - [x] Proposal execution logic
  - [x] One submission per user per chapter
  - [x] One vote per user per proposal

- [x] **StoryTreasury.sol** - Revenue distribution system
  - [x] Revenue sharing percentages
  - [x] Distribution logic for NFT sales
  - [x] Reward claiming mechanism

#### Contract Testing & Security
- [x] **Unit Tests** - Comprehensive test coverage for all contracts
  - [x] StoryNFT functionality tests (28/29 tests passing)
  - [x] PlotVoting logic tests (28/29 tests passing)
  - [x] Treasury distribution tests (28/29 tests passing)
  - [x] Reputation system tests (28/29 tests passing)
